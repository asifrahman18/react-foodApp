Hello and welcome. I am Asif Rahman, and my presentation topic is Swamp in China.

Let's start with the most obvious question. Which is, What exactly is a swamp?

If anyone asked me this question. Me, as someone who spent most of my childhood watching discovery and national geographic channel. I would imagine a place mostly with water, green plants, reptiles like snakes and crocodiles.

If we look at the definition of swamp we will see that swamp is a type of wetland that is characterized by stagnant water, waterlogged soil and high presence of aquatic vegetation.

So turns out, my imagination is not too far off the actual meaning.

Now that we have an idea about swamps, let us take a look at Swamp in China

Like many other countries, china also has some swamp areas. There are over 1000 provincial swamps in china, covering 3.8% of the land. Natural swamp area of china can be divided into 8 distinct regions. Among which 23% is freshwater swamp and 51% is coastal swamp.

Dominant vegetation of china swamp areas include Cares, Phragmites and Acorus species. Swamp provides various ecosystem services like filtering pollutants, reducing flooding and provide habitant for wildlife.

Now let's turn our attention to one of the swamps in China. The Xilin Basin swamp, located in the Xilingon region of Inner Mongolia. This is the only inland river swamp in China.

To understand this swamp, we first need to know what an inland river is. We know that rivers flow into the sea or ocean. But, inland rivers do not flow directly into any sea or ocean. Inland rivers are those rivers that drain into other rivers rather than flowing directly into the ocean. The Xilin Basin swamp is fed by inland rivers flowing north from the Mongolian mountains

Lets get back to Xilin swamp. So, there are three type of wetlands around that river. These are Marsh, Saline Meadow and lowland meadow. Lowland meadow has higher species diversity among these three. Over 140 bird species and 234 plant species have been recorded here.

Unfortunately, the Xilin Basin swamp faces serious threats. Urban expansion, tourism, and desertification are degrading this habitat. Up to 58% of the wetland vegetation has disappeared over the past 30 years.

Losing these swamps would mean losing the animals that rely on them. I hope people can take care of those swamps so these special places thrive for many years to come. With a little help, swamps, plants, and animals can flourish once again!

So everyone, that was all from me. I hope you all liked it.
Thank You!
